    <P>And that is my lecture timetable for school. Sometimes school can be stressful, especially on Thursdays, I mean that's the day I hate the most, no free time, just all round lectures to top it all I feel like Thursday's is one day of the slowest day of the week, but on Wednesday and Friday are on my favourites, especially Friday.</P>
    <p>
        Cause after lectures, I go for Jumaat with my friends, praying together with friends can be sure interesting. After our prayers, we head over to the sports center to play football and watch matches.. Or sometimes we just sit under a tree, enjoy the cool fresh and gist till evening.

    <p>Let's dont go into all that, Friday's are sure interesting for me, besides did you know that <b>'I am single'</b>.................</p>
    <p>
        Yes.. I know right, fine boy like me, so using this page, I would love to ask any female users seeing this right now if you would love to be my girlfriend. So firstly I will be dropping some Images of me first.. Yeah, for a proper introduction and for you to feel more comfortable <b>'wink' 'wink'</b>
