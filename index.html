    <h4>Hi there,</h4>
    <h2>I am Samud Olawale</h2>

    <span>This website is base on a project given to me to create a content about myself and using the project to practice all learnt Html tags from my class, e.g</span>
    <ul>
        <li>Table tag</li>
        <li>Image tag</li>
        <li>Selection button</li>
        <li>e.t.c</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Once again I am Samad Olawale, and I will be using this as my first page to tell you a little about myself,
        and in the second all that I have learnt from my class will be dispalyed. <br> <b>'Thank you!!'</b>
    </p>

    <h2>A LITTLE STORY ABOUT MYSELF</h2>
    <p>
        Hi, I am Samud Olawale. I am a student of KWASU (Kwara State University), in the faculty of science, studying computer Science. I am a 100 level degree student and my best colour is blue.
        I live in the Island with my parents and siblings at no. 52 Tokunboh street. One of my favourites food which I love eating the most is boli and groundnut, the taste of a roasted plantain feels my tongues with so much pleasure and I love how it goes well with groundnuts also. During my leisure time I love going to the mini campus around my area to hang out with friends and watch football mathes. I still remember back then in my Junior Secondary School, I use to go for Karate trainig, that was one of the most favourite thing I love doing, fighting is my hobby.
        In the future I would love to be AI tech creator. 
        <br>
        And that's a little details about me, <b>Thanks</b>
    </p>
